The server has been tested and deployed on red5 0.8.0.


* Layout

The configuration/compilation files are expecting by default that the
red5 directory is at the same level as the visu source directory,
i.e.:

PATH/red5
PATH/visu/visu - server sources
PATH/visu/VisuClient - client sources

* Database initialisation

  Configure the mysql connnection in
  webapp/WEB-INF/classes/ibatis/sqlMapConfig.xml

  Create a "visu" database with the appropriate login/password credentials.

  Initialize an empty database from dump/empty_db.sql :
   mysql -u_login_ -p visu < dump/empty_db.sql

  Create an admin user from dump/admin_db.sql:
   mysql -u_login_ -p visu < dump/admin_db.sql

* Compilation 

Since we are completely rebuilding the version 2, we are working on 
a global ANT build file for building both client and server side.
Still in a "work in progress" state, you can see 
VisuApplication/build directory for the client part.
